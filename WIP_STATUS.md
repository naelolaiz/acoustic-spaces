# WIP: barriers in wind in the parabolic equation (work in progress)

Replaces draft PR #180's ray method. The owner chose on 2026-11-03 to compute barriers in wind with the
engine's parabolic equation (the barrier inside the PE). Owner answers: the PE runs all eight bands for
points and maps (Q1); the barrier's own wind field is a documented limit in v1 (Q2); the still-air two-edge
fix comes after v1 as its own PR (Q3).

## State

Building v1 from `wip/barrier-pe-design.md`, following its one-day plan (section 12).

- Step 1 done: thin screens and rigid roofs in the narrow-angle PE (`parabolic.march(obstacles=...)`, obstacles
  as (near, far, top)), screens (and buildings as two screens) in the wide-angle PE, `refracting=` to force the
  steep split, `steps_per_wavelength`. Holds: with no obstacles (or one beyond the farthest listener) both
  solvers are bit-identical to main, independent and not; screens equal design B's patch exactly (it differs
  only for a listener exactly at a screen's range in an independent run, which now gets the screened field in
  both modes); screens and roofs equal design A's prototype exactly; roof wind effect within 0.15 dB of the
  full-wave solution (125 Hz); 0.006 dB/mm level and 0.002 dB/mm in the wind effect across grid nodes (500 Hz);
  quarter-wavelength grid within 0.1 dB of a tenth at 1 kHz. Tests: `tests/test_parabolic_obstacles.py`
  (13, all fail on main).
- Step 2 (roof floor) done with step 1.

## Open

Steps 3-7: layout cut, requests and runs, placement, validation script, docs; then V1-V6.

## Next

`Layout.barriers` and the cut along each one-degree azimuth bin.
